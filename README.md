# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**\*TailwindCss**
we can give any values rather then the suggested value we called it the arbitary values --> text-[13vw]

leading-none --> remove the extra spacing above and before spacing

tracking-tighter--> remove spacese between the text space between D O C S (before) DOCS (after using tracking tighter)

bg-sky-800/20 ---> this (/20) will make the colour transperent

1-> made the cards 
2--> made a object name data in forground.jsx and passed the data in the card as props by passing 
//below we are getting the values from props there wre two way
// 1st way function Card(props) -> we can write and we have to write props.data every where needed
// 2nd way we use {} and performing destructuring function Card({data})

3-->
